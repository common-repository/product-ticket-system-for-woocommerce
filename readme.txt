Boost customer support with our WooCommerce Product Ticket System. Let customers create tickets from orders; admins manage with ease.

**Clients effortlessly raise support tickets from their orders and receive email alerts upon ticket replies, simplifying their support journey.**

*Enhance customer support on your WooCommerce store with our Product Ticket System. Enable customers to create support tickets based on their orders, while administrators manage them seamlessly. Effortlessly streamline communication, resolve queries, and boost customer satisfaction.*

Revolutionize customer support on your WooCommerce platform with our innovative plugin, the Product Ticket System For WooCommerce. Upon activation, it seamlessly introduces a custom post type, 'Support Tickets', and a dedicated settings tab for easy configuration.

From the settings menu, you can tailor ticket fields, designate ticket management users, and refine email templates to suit your brand. Our plugin ensures smooth communication by triggering emails with every chat message exchange, facilitating seamless interactions between customers and administrators.

Both customers and administrators have the ability to close tickets, promoting efficient query resolution. However, ticket reopening remains an exclusive privilege reserved for administrators.
